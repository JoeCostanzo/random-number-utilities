    <strong>Welcome to the Authoritative Random Number Utility Suite.</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    This application uses government-certified, authoritative random number sources (via accessing publicly-available online APIs). Therefore, the results produced are not 'pseudo-random' (as many so-called 'random' / impostor apps in widespread usage suffer from), but rather are guaranteed TRUE random numbers, which can be proven via timestamp verification code.
  </p>
  <p>
    The random number data (seed data) is cached to your device upon it's retrieval from the internet, and then is used in the various tools within the app.
  </p>

      Request a number
    </button>
    <p>Simply enter your desired range, and receive a certified-random number between the minimum and maximum you set!</p>
    <button ion-button block (click)='toPage(2)'>
      Coin toss simulation!
    </button>
    <p>The classic randomness example, except this version (as all within the app do) uses the hard-science based back-end algorithm as described above, with certified government agency random numbers as seed data.</p>
